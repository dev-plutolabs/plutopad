# PlutoPAD

**ESP32/Arduino library for communicating with a PlutoPAD, allowing users to easily integrate the bluetooth controller into their projects.**  
PlutoPAD library manages all PlutoPAD states using a compact packet structure and provides user-defined callbacks for button events, connections, and disconnections. Ideal for robotics and embedded projects (like PlutoBUG), it offers a simple and reliable wireless control interface.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Supports 16 digital buttons packed into a 2-byte data packet  
- Automatic reconnection if the controller disconnects  
- User-defined callbacks for:
  - Button state changes
  - Connection events
  - Disconnection events  
- Human-readable button name lookup  
- Designed for ESP32 using Bluetooth Classic (SPP)  
- Optimized for microcontroller-based robotics projects
